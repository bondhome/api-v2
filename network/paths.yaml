  summary: Reset Ethernet Settings to Default
  description: |
    Bond will clear settings for Ethernet, defaulting to DHCP,
    DHCP-provided DNS (with fallback to hard-coded DNS servers),
    and Ethernet being preferred over Wi-Fi if both are available.

    This will NOT disable the Ethernet port. If the attached network
    supports DHCP and has an internet connection, the Bond will continue
    to function on Ethernet.

    For compatibility reasons, the PATCH endpoint can also be accessed

    Customize the Ethernet interface.

    The Bond immediately saves the settings in non-volatile storage,
    and therefore the settings will persist even after power cycle.

    If `ip`, `gw`, and `netmask` are all present, the Bond will attempt to use
    the three values to configure its Ethernet interface's IP address, default gateway,
    and netmask, respectively. If any of these fields are present, all three must
    be present.

    For DNS, Bond always tries default DNS servers first. However, our chosen
    DNS servers are blocked on some networks, so Bond will fall back to DNS
    servers provided by DHCP or specified by `dns` and `dns_alt`. If `dns` or
    `dns_alt` are provided, Bond will ignore any DNS servers proposed
    by DHCP. This behavior was decided upon after many customer service interactions
    which revealed an epidemic of bad ISP DNS servers which prevent what we
    originally though was reasonable: respecting the DHCP-provided servers by default.

    Get the name (base64-encoded in `ssid`) of the Wi-Fi network to which the Bond is currently connected.

    A numerical `status` field is also provided (see details below).

    The BSSID of the network's access point is provided, hex-encoded in `bssid`.
    If `bssid_set` is present and `true`, then the Bond has been configured to
    only connect to an access point with a specific BSSID, specified in an
    earlier PUT.

    The MAC address of the Bond is also provided, hex-encoded in `mac`. If this MAC
    address is not available, it will be `null`.

    Some network configuration fields are returned: the Bond's IP address (`ip`),
    its default gateway (`gw`), its netmask (`netmask`), and its DNS and fallback
    DNS (`dns` and `dns_alt`). `static_ip_set` is present and `true` if a previous
    PUT has configured the Bond to use static values for these field. `dns_set`
    and `dns_alt_set` are present and `true` if an earlier PUT has configured the
    DNS used by the Bond.

    For compatibility reasons, the PATCH endpoint can also be accessed
    using the PUT method.

    Instruct the Bond to connect to the network specified.

    The Bond immediately saves the settings in non-volatile storage,
    and therefore the settings will persist even after power cycle.

    The network name must be specified in `ssid` (base64-encoded).
    A `password` (again base64-encoded) is required unless it is an unsecured (open) network.
    The required security type (WEP/WPA/WPA2) is automatically determined by the Bond.

    If `ip`, `gw`, and `netmask` are all present, the Bond will attempt to use
    the three values to configure its STA interface's IP address, default gateway,
    and netmask, respectively. If any of these fields are present, all three must
    be present.

    For DNS, Bond always tries default DNS servers first. However, our chosen
    DNS servers are blocked on some networks, so Bond will fall back to DNS

    by DHCP. This behavior was decided upon after many customer service interactions
    which revealed an epidemic of bad ISP DNS servers which prevent what we
    originally though was reasonable: respecting the DHCP-provided servers by default.

    If `bssid` is present, the Bond will only connect to an access point with the supplied,
    hex-encoded BSSID.

  summary: Scan for Wi-Fi networks
  description: |
    A GET request starts a new Wi-Fi network scan (unless a scan is already in progress),
    and returns the results of the most recently completed scan. It is not an error for scan to be
    called before the scan has completed; however, the old results will be returned.
    A 204 is returned if no scan has been run yet since boot.

    The `results` are returned as a nested JSON array (a 2D table) rather than a JSON object for compactness.
    The `format` array gives the meaning of each column of the `results` table.

    The `ssid` field contains the network name. It is base64-encoded because arbitrary characters are allowed by the Wi-Fi standard.

    The `auth` field gives the type of network security:
      - 0 = unsecured (open)
      - 1 = WEP
      - 2 = WPA PSK
      - 3 = WPA2 PSK
      - 4 = WPA/WPA2 PSK
      - 5 = WPA2 Enterprise [currently unsupported by Bond]

    Note that for `auth` types 0 and 1, the application should
    warn the user that the network could be more secure,
    and should be set to WPA2 for best security.

    The `signal` field contains an indication of access point signal quality
    (which may be derived from signal strength and/or signal-to-noise ratio),
    ranging from 0 to 100.

    If `hidden_requires_bssid` is present and true, and the user wants to connect
    to a hidden network, the user must supply the BSSID (that is, the MAC address
    of the access point).
