        IP address or domain name of the MQTT broker.
        If set to empty string, the default Bond Cloud server will be used.
    port:
      example: 8883
      type: number
      description: |
        Specify a different port number for the MQTT broker.
        If set to 0, the Bond Cloud default port number will be used (8883).
        Note that the communication is secured by TLS (SSL).
    cert_set:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        If true, a custom Bond certificate has been loaded.
        If false, the Bond's default certificate will be used.
    cert:
      example: "certificate_goes_here"
      type: string
      writeOnly: true
      description: |
        Specify a custom Bond certificate.
        Typically, this is the Bond-specific certificate
        concatenated with the Bond-signing CA certificate.
        Write to empty string to go back to the Bond's default certificate.
    key_set:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        If true, a custom Bond private key has been loaded.
        If false, the Bond's default private key will be used.
    key:
      example: "key_goes_here"
      type: string
      writeOnly: true
      description: |
        Specify a custom Bond private key.
        Write to empty string to go back to the Bond's default private key.
    server_cert_set:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        If true, a custom server CA has been loaded.
        If false, the Bond Cloud CA will be used.
    enable:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      description: |
        [Added in v3.3.3]
        If true (default), Bond will attempt MQTT connection. If MQTT connection fails, Bond becomes discoverable again via Config AP.
        If false, Bond will not attempt MQTT connection and Config AP will remain deactivated.
    server_cert:
      example: "certificate_goes_here"
      type: string
      writeOnly: true
      description: |
        Specify a custom MQTT server CA.
        Set to empty string to return to default.
    server_cert_check:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Set to false to disable verification of the MQTT server CA.
        It is strongly recommend to leave this option enabled,
        because otherwise a man-in-the-middle attack is possible.

    summary: Configure MQTT Transport
    description: |
      IMPORTANT NOTE: MQTT redirection is currently untested. If you have a use
      case for this API, please let us know on [the forums](https://forum.bondhome.io/)
      so that we can better prioritize implementing this API.

      Configure the Bond's MQTT Transport, which is used for communication
      with the Bond Cloud or an offline MQTT broker.
      Note that Bond uses MQTT over TLS with certificate-based authentication.
      Password-based authentication is not supported.

      Some advanced users may elect to run their own MQTT brokers,
      so this endpoint allows customizing of the MQTT broker address
      and the various related security settings.

      Note that any manipulation of this endpoint will result in the
      Bond disconnecting from Bond Cloud, and therefore integrations
      and control away from home will become unavailable.
      
      NOTE: All settings only take effect after reboot.
