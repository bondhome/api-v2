          - `true`: Bond is paired and is not discoverable.

          That means the Bond will delete all info, unpairing if paired and set enabled to default (0).
          If you have not removed the Bond from your account on Home app, the Bond and its devices
          will show as not responding. You can remove from the Home app later as usual.
