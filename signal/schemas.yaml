Signal:
  type: object
  properties:
    freq:
      example: 434000
      type: number
      description: |
        Frequency in kHz:
          - `>= 1000` is RF
          - `< 1000` is IR

        Bond Bridge can only receive IR signals at or near 38 kHz,
        and will report all IR signals as 38 kHz.

        Bond Bridge currently transmits all IR signals at 38 kHz also.
    modulation:
      example: OOK
      type: string
      description: |
        - `OOK` = on-off keying
        - `GFSK` = gaussian frequency-shift keying

        If not provided, defaults to `OOK`.
    data:
      example: "110100110110H"
      type: string
      description: |
        String representation of data bits to be transmitted.

        The maximum length of the data string is 6144 bytes.
    encoding:
      example: "cq"
      type: string
      description: |
        Specifies the encoding of the data string.

        In all cases, the duration of each bit is 1/`bps` seconds.

        ### CQ encoding (`"cq"`)

        This is a simple encoding where bits are represented using `0` and `1`,
          with some abbreviations for sequences of bits.

        Each character represents one or more bits:

          - `0` single zero bit
          - `1` single one bit
          - `C` 2^0 (1) zero bits
          - `D` 2^1 (2) zero bits
          - `E` 2^2 (4) zero bits
          - `F` 2^3 (8) zero bits
          - ...
          - `Q` 2^14 (16384) zero bits
          - `c` thru `q` are just like `C` thru `Q`, but for one bits
          - `A` the three bits 110
          - `B` the three bits 011

        ### Hex (`"hex"`)

        This is a simple encoding where the data string consists of hex bytes.
        Each hex byte represents 8 bits of data.

        Hex encoding is currently limited to only work at `40000` bps.

        This is the default encoding for scan results.

    bps:
      example: 1000
      type: number
      description: |
        Bitrate of `data`. Range is 100 to 40000.

        If not provided, `40000` is assumed.
    reps:
      example: 12
      type: number
      description: |
        Number of times that data should be repeated.

        If not provided, `1` is assumed.
    use_scan:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      writeOnly: true
      description: |
        If present and true, the Signal recorded by the most recent scan will
        be used, with all other fields ignored
Scan:
  type: object
  properties:
    freq:
      example: 434000
      type: number
      description: |
        Frequency to scan in kHz.

        If not provided, scan will search all RF frequencies, but not IR.

        Specify `38` to explicitly scan IR.
    modulation:
      example: OOK
      type: string
      description: |
        - `OOK` = on-off keying
        - `GFSK` = gaussian frequency-shift keying

        If not provided, defaults to `OOK`.

        Only applicable to RF.

        (GFSK scanning currently unimplemented.)
    running:
      example: false
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        If true, scan is running.
    total_timeout:
      example: 30
      type: number
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        The time from scan start to scan timeout, in
        seconds.
    success:
      example: true
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        If true, a signal was found.
