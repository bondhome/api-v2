  # Introduction

  ## Scope

  The Bond V2 API allows control of Ceiling Fans, Fireplaces,
  and other Bond devices. It is intended for integration with offline control
  systems, for use by advanced users, hobbiests, integrators, and installers.

  For the purposes of device control,
  it does not matter whether these devices are
  remote-controlled devices that Work with Bond (connected via a Bond Bridge)
  or smart devices that are Smart by Bond.

  This documentation describes the Local HTTP API for Bond products running v2 firmware.
  This API does not require an internet connection, but does require that the API client
  be able to directly communicate with the Bond over HTTP. Typically this means being
  on the same Wi-Fi network. We are still working on a Cloud API, which will be very similar to the Local API.

  ## Contributing

  We welcome your corrections and improvements to this documentation!
  You can find the source code for the documentation at the link below.

  ## Security

  The Bond Local API uses unencrypted HTTP
  using a simple token-based authentication mechanism.

  ### Why HTTP and not HTTPS?

  After speaking with many users interested in Local API,
  we discovered that users were satisfied with the protection provided
  by their Wi-Fi network's password, and that it is more important to
  provide easy and low-latency control of Bond devices than to provide
  security against other devices and users on the Wi-Fi network.

  Furthermore, it can be challenging for an API client to use HTTPS securely.
  In order to protect against malicious devices or users inside your Wi-Fi network,
  it would be necessary for an HTTPS API client to check the validity of the
  Bond's HTTPS certificate against an Olibra Certificate Authority.
  The web standard of using domain-based certificate chain-of-trust
  does not work when offline, because the Bond does not have a domain name,
  being a device on your local network rather than on the public internet.
  As a consequence, an HTTPS API would not work from many webbrowsers due to
  the certificate being untrusted.

  That said, if you have untrusted users or devices on your Wi-Fi network,
  we recommend placing Bond on a seperate home automation network
  to which the untrusted users do not have the password.

  ### Security on the Internet

  Rest assured that when Bond products communicate with Bond Cloud
  (which is needed for integration and voice control support),
  we use industry-standard secure TLS connections,
  secured with per-unit public key cryptography. There is no unencrypted
  communication between Bond hardware and Bond Cloud.

  Please be sure to always use Bond behind a firewall,
  and do not set up port-forwarding to the Bond Local API,
  to ensure that unsecured communications do not take place over the public internet.
  
  ## Firmware Versions

  To get the optimal match between this documentation and your Bond's exposed API,
  we recommend you update your Bond to the most recent firmware available. In situations
  where part of this API is only available on Beta firmware, we will try to make this
  clear. To use such a feature, you'll need to upgrade your firmware with a Beta app.
  You can sign up to receive Beta apps through one of the links in
  [this post](https://forum.bondhome.io/t/bond-local-api-public-beta-link/589), and we will
  typically post about Beta features in the
  [Beta category of the forums](https://forum.bondhome.io/c/beta/5)

  # Getting Started

  ## Finding the Bond IP

  First, power on a Bond device and connect it to your Wi-Fi network.
  Use the Bond app to confirm that the Bond's firmware is at least version v2.

  The newest versions of the Bond Home app (starting in v2.15) have the Bond's IP address
  in the Bond's "Network Info" screen.  Tapping it will copy it to your clipboard.
  If `ping` is more convenient for you,
  please refer to the instructions below.

  From your PC connected to the same network, try pinging the Bond.
  For example, if your Bond ID is ZZBL12345, you can ping it by running
  the following command in a terminal:

      ping BB18038.local

  You should see the IP address printed, along with reply messages.
  Press Ctrl-C to exit the ping program:

      PING bb18038.local (192.100.0.61): 56 data bytes
      64 bytes from 192.100.0.61: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=96.800 ms
      64 bytes from 192.100.0.61: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=34.902 ms
      64 bytes from 192.100.0.61: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=4.226 ms
      ^C
      --- bb18038.local ping statistics ---
      3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
      round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 4.226/45.309/96.800/38.503 ms

  You can see the IP address of this Bond is `192.100.0.61`.

  Note that the lookup from Bond ID to IP address is performed using mDNS.
  You will need to make sure that mDNS is installed and enabled on
  your system (this is the default for most Linux distros and on MacOS).

  You can search for all Bonds on your local network.
  On Linux, do:

      avahi-browse -a | grep bond

  And on MacOS, do:

      dns-sd -B _bond._tcp .

  In both cases, you will see a list of Bonds on your Wi-Fi network
  and their IP addresses.

  ## Check Bond Version

  Next, let's check the Bond's firmware version.
  To do this, we will use a command-line utility called cURL.
  cURL is installed by default on MacOS and most Linux distributions.

  To check the firmware version, run this command:

      curl -i http://192.100.0.61/v2/sys/version

  The flag `-i` means "display header information".
  You should see output similar to this:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Length: 243
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

      {"target":"snowbird","fw_ver":"v2.5.2","fw_date":"Fri Feb 22 14:13:25 -03 2019","make":"Olibra LLC","model":"model","branding_profile":"O_SNOWBIRD","uptime_s":380,"_":"c342ae74"}

  Where, we see the firmware version is `v2.5.2`.

  ## Getting the Bond Token

  Note that no token is required for the version endpoint,
  but other endpoints will require token-based authentication.
  
  The Bond Home app has the Bond's token in the Bond's "Settings" screen. Tapping it will copy it to your clipboard.
  If `curl` is more convenient for you, please refer to the instructions below.

  To get the token, follow this procedure:

    Power cycle the Bond, and then within 10 minutes, access the `token` endpoint as follows:

        curl -i http://192.100.0.61/v2/token

    You should see a return body containing `token` such as this:

      {locked":0,"pin_attempts_left":10,"token":"f074b61f628018fd","nonce":"0000000000000000","v1_nonce":"0000000000000000","account_code":"","v1_email":"","_":"c9bb9590"}

    Copy the token and use it with a `BOND-Token` header in subsequent requests.

    Alternatively, the token may be provided by setting the `_token` field within the request body. [Since v2.6.23]

  ## Get Device Information

  To get a list of devices on the Bond, do:

      curl -H "BOND-Token: f074b61f628018fd" -i http://192.100.0.61/v2/devices

  Or, to use the embedded token technique:

      curl -i http://192.100.0.61/v2/devices -X GET -d "{\"_token\": \"f074b61f628018fd\"}"

  You will get a list of devices such as this:

      {"_":"f7e407f1","79135791":{"_":"599b0fc5"}}

  Here we see there is one device with id `79135791`.

  We can request the device details by doing:

      curl -H "BOND-Token: f074b61f628018fd" -i http://192.100.0.61/v2/devices/79135791

  And we can see the device name, location, and available Actions:

      {"name":"Magic Fan","type":"CF","actions":["TurnOn","TurnOff","SetSpeed","IncreaseSpeed","DecreaseSpeed"],"location":"Dungeon","_":"599b0fc5","commands":{"_":"be8e1896"}}

  ## Set the Fan Speed

  Finally, let's try setting the fan's speed:

      curl -H "BOND-Token: f074b61f628018fd" -i http://192.100.0.61/v2/devices/79135791/actions/SetSpeed -X PUT -d "{\"argument\": 3}"

  # API Concepts

  ## Hash Tree

  The Bond API is organized as a tree of endpoints,
  starting at the root. Here's an incomplete example:

      - v2
        - devices
          - 00000001
            - commands
            - state
          - 00000002
            - commands
            - state
          - 00000003
            - commands
            - state
        - sys
          - wifi

  Clearly, if the entire tree were expanded on a request of the root,
  then the resulting request may be very large! This large response body
  would cause several problems, including taking a long time to transmit over
  slow networks, taking time to generate, and being too large to be effectively
  transmitted over the message-based protocol MQTT.

  Therefore, Bond only returns a single level of the tree on every request.

  Each node of the tree has a 32-bit "hash" value which is changed
  whenever that node, or any of the child nodes, are modified.
  This hash is provided in every reply body as the "_" object.

  When a requested endpoint has children that are not expanded,
  the child values are replaced with just the child hashes.

  For example, when requesting the `devices` endpoint,
  you may receive the following response:

      {"_":"f7e407f1","79135791":{"_":"599b0fc5"}}

  Let's break this down:

    - `"_":"f7e407f1"` : This is the hash value of the devices object.
       If any devices are added, modified, or deleted, this hash will change.

    - `"79135791"` : This is the device id of the one device on this Bond.

    - `{"_":"599b0fc5"}` : This is the hash object representing device with id `79135791`.

  If the API client wants to get the name of the device, it is necessary to make
  a seperate request on the device itself: `GET devices/79135791`,
  which would return the name and location directly associated with the device,
  as well as hash objects for the child nodes of device: `commands` and `state`.

  ## Request ID

  The purpose of the Request ID is to allow a client to retry a non-idempotent
  request (PUT, POST, PATCH, or DELETE) without risk of Bond taking the same
  action twice.

  If you need to implement a retry mechanism in your integration,
  please contact the Bond Engineering Team via the Bond Forums https://forum.bondhome.io/

  # Bond Push UDP Protocol (BPUP)
  
  CAVEAT: BPUP is currently in Beta status. Breaking changes may occur to this API as we collect community feedback.

  A common problem in writing drivers to support Bond devices is a need
  to update the client whenever device state changes. With the HTTP API,
  this implies inefficient polling. So we've added support for "Bond Push",
  a UDP-based API for low-latency control and feedback within the local network.

  A client initiates a connection by opening a UDP socket to the Bond on
  port 30007 and sending a Keep-Alive datagram, which is just a single
  newline character. This subscribes the client to state updates from devices.
  Equivalent to the regex `devices/.*/state`.

  The Bond will acknowledge the subscription by immediately replying with
  the Bond ID:

      {"B":"ZZBL12345"}\n

  The client should continue to send the Keep-Alive
  datagram on the same socket every 60 seconds to keep the connection active.
  If no Keep-Alive datagram is received after 125 seconds,
  Bond will stop sending feedback to the client.

  A future update will allow subscribing to a different topic pattern.

  The Bond will send to all active clients Update datagrams consisting of
  a JSON object terminated by a newline character. Here's an example Update datagram:

      {"B":"ZZBL12345","t":"devices/aabbccdd/state","i":"00112233bbeeeeff","s":200,"m":0,"f":255,"b":{"_":"ab9284ef","power":1,"speed":2}}\n

  Breaking down the fields:

    - `B`: the Bond ID
    - `t`: topic (the path from HTTP URL)
    - `i`: request ID
    - `s`: HTTP status code
    - `m`: HTTP method (0=GET, 1=POST, 2=PUT, 3=DELETE, 4=PATCH)
    - `f`: flags (Olibra-internal use)
    - `x`: source transport (transport from which the request was received. Can be: "http", "mqtt", "bond" (gratuitous reply), "cli" (serial terminal), with other values reserved for future use)
    - `b`: HTTP response body

  There's also some client-specific error messages,

      {"B":"ZZBL12345","err_id":631,"err_msg":"BPUP client timeout"}\n

  For feature requests and concerns, please contact the Bond Engineering Team
  via the Bond Forums https://forum.bondhome.io/

  # MQTT
  
  IMPORTANT NOTE: MQTT redirection is implemented, but is currently untested. It may
  not work at all. If you have a use case for this API, please let us know on 
  [the forums](https://forum.bondhome.io/) so that we can better prioritize implementing
  and testing this API.

  You can configure your Bond to communicate with a custom MQTT broker through the `api/mqtt`
  endpoint.

  When the Bond connects to its configured MQTT broker, it subscribes to the topic
  `v2/<Bond ID>/down/#`, where `#` is a wildcard. It publishes messages to
  `v2/<Bond ID>/up/<subtopic>`, where the subtopic is that indicated in this documentation
  less the `v2/` prefix.

  A concrete example: requesting devices from the Bond.

  The equivalent to HTTP GET `v2/devices` from a Bond with ID ZZBL12345 is publishing 
  a message to `v2/ZZBL12345/down/devices` with the payload `{"m": 0}` (since the default
  for `"m"` (HTTP method) is 0 (`GET`), this payload could also just be `{}`)

  The Bond, if it had a single device with id `12345678`, would then
  publish to `v2/ZZBL12345/up/devices` with the payload
  
    `{"B": "ZZBL12345", "t": "devices", "m": 0, "i": <randomly-generated request ID>,
    "s": 200, "f": 255, "b" {"_": <devices hash>, "12345678": {"_": <12345678's hash>}}}`

  Breaking down the fields:

    - `B`: the Bond ID
    - `t`: subtopic (the path from HTTP URL, without the `v2/` prefix)
    - `i`: request ID
    - `s`: HTTP status code
    - `m`: HTTP method (0=GET, 1=POST, 2=PUT, 3=DELETE, 4=PATCH)
    - `f`: flags (Olibra-internal use)
    - `b`: HTTP response body
  
  (Note: the first two fields are redundant, they could be extracted from the MQTT topic)

  The MQTT broker to which the Bond is connected is treated as trusted, so token
  authentication is not necessary. Make sure you check the server certificate using
  the appropriate fields in the `api/mqtt` endpoint to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.

  # Glossary

  ## Bond Bridge

  The Bond Bridge, also referred to simply as "Bond",
  connects RF- and IR-controlled devices to Wi-Fi.
  Learn more at https://bondhome.io/product/.

  ## Smart by Bond

  A "Smart by Bond" appliance is a smart appliance that
  uses the API described here, other than those parts
  designated as "Bridge Only".

  ## Device

  Within the Bond ecosystem, the term "device" always refers to
  a home appliance connected to Bond. A Bond Bridge is not itself a device.

  ## Feature

  Bond devices support one or more "features", such as Speed or Brightness,
  which come with a set of Actions, State Variables, and Properties
  that define and control some aspect of the device.

  For example, a device which supports the Light feature will always
  have actions for TurnLightOn, TurnLightOff, and ToggleLight.
  Furthermore, it will always have the `light` state variable.

  See the Features section below for detail on all supported features.

  ## Action

  Devices are controlled by calling "actions" such as SetSpeed or TurnOff.

  Some actions require an "argument" to be included. For example,
  SetSpeed requires an integer argument with the speed number to set.

  Actions represent a user's intent, but do not nessisarly map one-to-one
  onto the commands that are sent to a device.
  Actions abstract away the complexity of the underlying commands needed
  to achieve the desired change in state of a device.

  ## Commands

  Bond Bridges operate by translating actions into "commands".
  While actions are in a user's language, commands are in the device's remote control's
  language. Often there is a one-to-one mapping from actions to commands,
  for example, most ceiling fans have distinct RF commands for each speed.
  So the action "SetSpeed(3)" is always translated into the same RF signal
  that tells the device to go to the third speed.

  However, sometimes a device does not have a single command which always
  accomplishes a specific action. For example, most ceiling fans do not have
  a specific command corresponding to the TurnOn action, but rather, Bond
  remembers the previous speed that the fan was set to, and uses a particular
  SetSpeed command to accompish the TurnOn action. On the other hand,
  certain ceiling fans do have a specific TurnOn command. In that case the
  TurnOn action will always map to the TurnOn command. This results in the
  correct speed being restored even if the factory remote control was used.

  ## Signal

  The term "signal" refers to the actual RF or IR transmission sent to the
  remote-controlled device to accomplish a particular command.

  Every command should have exactly one corresponding signal. However,
  the Bond Bridge supports a number of `signal` endpoints which allow
  manipulation of signals directly, such as `signal/scan` to receive signals,
  or `signal/tx` to transmit a signal without association to a device.

  ## State Variable

  The Bond Bridge makes an effort to track the state of devices,
  and this state is represented by a set of "state variables",
  such as speed and brightness.

  Speed variables cannot be set directly, but rather are manipulated
  indirectly through actions. For example, the SetSpeed action with an
  argument of 3 has the side-effect of setting the speed state variable
  to 3 and the power variable to 1.

  ## Properties

  Some device Features have a "Property" which parameterizes the devices
  capabilities. For example, multi-speed ceiling fans supporting the Speed
  feature will always have a `max_speed` property which gives the maximum
  speed which the `speed` state variable may take.

  Some properties are read-only, others are PATCH-able.

  ### Feature Toggles

  Properties starting with `feature_` are called _feature toggles_,
  and always default to true.  When a feature toggle is set to false, 
  the corresponding feature is disabled along with all dependent features,
  leaving only the top-level feature toggle.

  For example, on a device with Light, UpDownLight, Brightness,
  and UpDownLightBrightness features, setting `feature_light` to false
  will cause all properties, state variables, and actions
  for all four of these features to be removed from the API,
  including the feature toggles `feature_brightness` and `feature_up_down_light`.
  Only `feature_light` will remain.

  The intended use of feature toggles is in the Bond Home application's
  device settings screen, wherein the currently visible feature toggles
  should correspond exactly to toggle switches. Furthermore, the client
  need not have any feature-specific code for this: the order
  of feature toggles in the properties JSON object may be used as the 
  UI display order, and the display names may be programmatically derived
  from the property names, e.g. `feature_up_down_light` displayed as
  "Up Down Light".

  Feature toggles are only available for some features, 
  and are currently only available for Smart by Bond devices.

  # Features

  Devices have a combination of actions, state variables, and fixed properties.
  In order to understand how these relate to each other,
  it is helpful to organize actions into features and study one feature at a time.

  ## Power

  The Power feature controls the basic on/off state of a device.

  For Ceiling Fans, it refers to the state of the fan motor.
  Note that most ceiling fans have lights which are not governed
  by the Power feature.

  For Fireplaces, it refers to the state of the flame.
  Note that many fireplaces have separate light or fan functions,
   which are not governed by the Power feature.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **power**: (integer) 1 = on, 0 = off

  ### Actions

  - **TurnOn()**: Turn device power on.
  - **TurnOff()**: Turn device power off.
  - **TogglePower()**: Change device power from on to off, or off to on.

  ## Timer

  The Timer feature allows turning off a device after a specified delay,
  similar to the dial timer interface on toaster ovens.

  The Timer feature requires the Power feature.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **timer**: (integer) seconds remaining on timer, or 0 meaning no timer running

  ### Actions

  - **SetTimer(s)**: Start timer for `s` seconds. If power if off, device is
    implicitly turned on.
    If argument is zero, the timer is canceled without turning off the device.

  NOTE: The timer is canceled implicitly by any action on the Power, Speed,
    or Breeze features, other than TurnOn. For example, if a timer is running,
    and the user turns off the device and then turns it back on, the timer
    will be canceled and therefore the device will not turn off again
    unexpectedly. The intention that a timer is designed to help reduce
    energy consumption, but should never surprise the user who forgot that
    they enabled the timer function earlier.  When the timer reaches zero
    it runs TurnOff, so it will turn off the device whether it is set at a
    specific speed or it is set to breeze.

  ## Speed

  The Speed feature is used by multiple-speed Ceiling Fans to track the motor speed.

  The Speed feature requires the Power feature.

  Note that while many Fireplaces have a built-in fan,
   they do not use the Speed feature. See *FpFan* feature.

  ### Properties

   - **max_speed**: (integer, read-only) highest speed available

  ### State Variables

   - **speed**: (integer) value from 1 to max_speed. If power=0, speed represents the last speed setting and the speed to which the device resumes when user asks to turn on.

  ### Actions

  - **SetSpeed(speed)**: Set speed and turn on. If speed>max_speed, max_speed is assumed. If the fan is off, implicitly turn on the power. Setting speed to zero or a negative value is ignored.
  - **IncreaseSpeed(speeds)**: Increase speed of fan by specified number of *speeds*. If the fan is off, implicitly turn on the power.
  - **DecreaseSpeed(speeds)**: Decrease fan speed by specified number of *speeds*. If attempting to decrease fan speed below `1`, the fan will remain at speed 1. That is, power will not be implicitly turned off. If the power is already off, DecreaseSpeed is ignored.

  NOTE: When the device is turned off, the previous speed is remembered. When the fan is then turned back on, it will resume at the previous speed.

  ## Breeze

  The Breeze feature of many multi-speed Ceiling Fans provides a randomized breeze.

  Breeze works by pseudorandomly changing the power and speed of the fan over time to create a natural breeze effect.
  There are two parameters of the breeze which may be adjusted to provide
  the desired breeze effect.

  The Breeze feature requires the Speed feature.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **breeze**: (array) array of the form `[ <mode>, <mean>, <var> ]`:
     - **mode**: (integer) 0 = breeze mode disabled, 1 = breeze mode enabled
     - **mean**: (integer) sets the average speed. 0 = minimum average speed (calm), 100 = maximum average speed (storm)
     - **var**: (integer) sets the variability of the speed. 0 = minimum variation (steady), 100 = maximum variation (gusty)

  ### Actions

  - **BreezeOn()**: Enable breeze with remembered parameters. Defaults to [50,50].
  - **BreezeOff()**: Stop breeze. Fan remains on at current speed.
  - **SetBreeze(breeze)**: Enable breeze with specified parameters (same as breeze state variable).
    Example `SetBreeze([1, 20, 90])`.

  NOTE: If breeze is enabled when the fan is powered off, then breeze will be restored at power on.

  NOTE: Calling SetBreeze with first parameter equal to 0 will disable breeze,
    but still set the specified mean and var parameters.

  NOTE: SetSpeed implicitly disables breeze mode.

  ## Direction

  The Direction feature is used by reversible Ceiling Fans to track the direction of the fan motor.

  The Direction feature requires the Power feature.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **direction**: (integer) 1 = forward, -1 = reverse.

  The forward and reverse modes are sometimes called Summer and Winter, respectively.

  ### Actions

  - **SetDirection(direction)**: Control forward and reverse.
  - **ToggleDirection()**: Reverse the direction of the fan.

  ## Light

  The Light feature governs the basic on/off status of a device's main light.

  This is a very common feature of Ceiling Fans, and present on many Fireplaces.

  See the UpDownLight feature for the behavior of devices with dual lights.


  ### Properties

   - **feature_light**: (boolean, PATCH-able) true = Light feature enabled (default), false = Light feature disabled

  ### State Variables

   - **light**: (integer) 1 = light on, 0 = light off

  ### Actions

  - **TurnLightOn()**: Turn light on.
  - **TurnLightOff()**: Turn off light.
  - **ToggleLight()**: Change light from on to off, or off to on.

  ## UpDownLight

  The UpDownLight feature governs the on/off status of a device's upwards-
  and downards-facing lights,
  such as the ceiling-wash "up light" and direct "down light"
  found on some high-end ceiling fans.

  The corresponding physical remote often has seperate buttons for the UpLight
  and DownLight, but no button for just "Light". However, Bond always makes the
  Light feature available along with UpDownLight to make these devices easy to integrate.
  For example, saying "Alexa, Turn on the Light" corresponds to the TurnLightOn
  action, which will have a reasonable result for devices with UpDownLight.

  UpDownLight depends on Light feature.

  ### Properties

   - **feature_up_down_light**: (boolean, PATCH-able) true = Up Down Light feature enabled (default), false = Up Down Light feature disabled, both physical light circuits will operate as one Light.

  ### State Variables

   - **up_light**: (integer) 1 = up light enabled, 0 = up light disabled
   - **down_light**: (integer) 1 = down light enabled, 0 = down light disabled

   If both up_light and light are 1, then the up light will be on,
   and similar for down light.

   Note that both up_light and down_light may not be simultaneously zero,
   so that the device is always ready to respond to a TurnLightOn request.

  ### Actions

  - **TurnUpLightOn()**: Turn up light on.
  - **TurnDownLightOn()**: Turn down light on.
  - **TurnUpLightOff()**: Turn off up light.
  - **TurnDownLightOff()**: Turn off down light.
  - **ToggleUpLight()**: Change up light from on to off, or off to on.
  - **ToggleDownLight()**: Change down light from on to off, or off to on.

  Note that TurnLightOff/TurnLightOn honor the up_light and down_light
  enable variables. That is, the user is able to use the factory remote
  to select a prefered combination of up and down light, and that combination
  is restored when TurnLightOn is called, perhaps through a voice integration.

  ## Brightness

  The Brightness feature governs lights which can be dimmed to specified brightness level.

  This feature is common on classic Ceiling Fans whose remotes have displays.
  Note, however, that classic Ceiling Fans whose remotes do *not* have displays typically only support HoldToDim or HoldToDimUpDown feature.

  ### Properties

   - **feature_brightness**: (boolean, PATCH-able) true = Brightness feature enabled (default), false = Brightness feature disabled. When PATCH-ing to false, brightness is set to 100 prior to disabling the feature.

  ### State Variables

   - **brightness**: (integer) percentage value of brightness, 1-100. If light=0, brightness represents the last brightness setting and the brightness to resume when user turns on light. If fan has no dimmer or a non-stateful dimmer, brightness is always 100.

  ### Actions

  - **SetBrightness(brightness)**: Set the brightness of the light to specified percentage. Value of 0 is ignored, use TurnLightOff instead.
  - **IncreaseBrightness(amount)**: Increase brightness of light by specified percentage. If light is off, it will be turned on at (0 + amount).
  - **DecreaseBrightness(amount)**: Decrease light brightness by specified percentage. If attempting to decrease brightness below 1%, light will remain at 1%. Use TurnLightOff to turn off the light. If the light is off, the light will remain off but the remembered brightness will be decreased.

  NOTE: The brightness level is remembered on TurnLightOff and restored on TurnLightOn.


  ## UpDownBrightness

  The UpDownBrightness feature extends the Brightness feature to cover
  the ability of ceiling fans with separately dimmable up and down lights.

  This feature is almost only found on Smart by Bond Ceiling Fans.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **up_light_brightness**: (integer) percentage value of up light brightness, 1-100.
   - **down_light_brightness**: (integer) percentage value of down light brightness, 1-100.

  ### Actions

  - **SetUpLightBrightness(brightness)**: Similar to SetBrightness but only for the up light.
  - **SetDownLightBrightness(brightness)**: Similar to SetBrightness but only for the down light.
  - **IncreaseUpLightBrightness(amount)**: Similar to IncreaseBrightness but only for the up light.
  - **IncreaseDownLightBrightness(amount)**: Similar to IncreaseBrightness but only for the down light.
  - **DecreaseUpLightBrightness(amount)**: Similar to DecreaseBrightness but only for the up light.
  - **DecreaseDownLightBrightness(amount)**: Similar to DecreaseBrightness but only for the down light.

  NOTE: The brightness level of each light is remembered on
  TurnLightOff, TurnUpLightOff, TurnDownLightOff and restored on TurnLightOn,
  etc.

  NOTE: IncreaseBrightness and DecreaseBrightness operate on whichever
   of the up and down lights are enabled, but will never enable or disable
   one or the other light.

  ## Flame

  The Flame feature is used by fireplaces to indicate flame level.

  The Flame feature requires the Power feature.

  ### Properties

  ### State Variables

   - **flame**: (integer) value from 1 to 100. If power=0, flame represents the last flame setting and the flame to which the device resumes when user asks to turn on.

  ### Actions

  - **SetFlame(flame)**: Set flame and turn on. If flame>100, 100 is assumed. If the fireplace is off, implicitly turn on the power. Setting flame to zero or a negative value is ignored.
  - **IncreaseFlame(flames)**: Increase flame level of fireplace by specified number of *flames*. If the fireplace is off, implicitly turn on the power.
  - **DecreaseFlame(flames)**: Decrease flame level by specified number of *flames*. If attempting to decrease fireplace flame below `1`, the fireplace will remain at fflame 1. That is, power will not be implicitly turned off. If the power is already off, DecreaseFlame is ignored.

  ## Open

  The open feature is used to describe a device that can be opened and closed.
  Common use cases are motorized shades and garage doors.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **open**: (integer) 1 = open, 0 = closed

  ### Actions

  - **Open()**: Open the device.
  - **Close()**: Close the device.
  - **ToggleOpen()**: Close the device if it's open, open it if it's closed

  ### Notes

  If your remote has a discrete stopping command, consider using the **Hold()** action
  to stop the motion of the device.

  ## FpFan

  The FpFan feature controls a fireplace fan. The FpFan feature is independent
  of the power feature, which for fireplaces indicates whether the flame is on
  or off.

  ### Properties

  (none)

  ### State Variables

   - **fpfan_power**: (integer) 1 = on, 0 = off
   - **fpfan_speed**: (integer) from 1-100

  ### Actions

  - **TurnFpFanOff()**: Turn the fireplace fan off
  - **TurnFpFanOn()**: Turn the fireplace fan on, restoring the previous speed
  - **SetFpFan(speed)**: Sets the speed of the fireplace fan

  ## Misc, including dimmers

  Collected here are some actions that may be used with other features, but
  have no state-change behavior on the Bond.

  ### Actions

  - **Stop()**: This action tells the Bond to stop any in-progress transmission and empty its transmission queue.
  - **Hold()**: Can be used when a signal is required to tell a device to stop moving or the like, since *Stop* is a special "stop transmitting" action
  - **Pair()**: Used in devices that need to be paired with a receiver.
  - **StartDimmer()**: Start dimming. The Bond should time out its transmission after 30 seconds, or when the *Stop* action is called.
  - **StartUpLightDimmer()**: Use this and the *StartDownLightDimmer* instead of *StartDimmer* if your device has two dimmable lights.
  - **StartDownLightDimmer()**: The counterpart to *StartUpLightDimmer*
  - **StartIncreasingBrightness()**: Similar to StartDimmer, but doesn't cycle and only increases brightness.
  - **StartDecreasingBrightness()**: Similar to StartDimmer, but doesn't cycle and only decreases brightness.
