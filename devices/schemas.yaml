      type: string
    template:
      description: |
        An internal name describing what sort of protocol the remote represented
        by the device implements. Upon a POST with a valid template string, the
        device self-populates its panel with some default controls, initializes
        its state, and finds a script to define its behavior.

        Most templated devices need additional parameters, such as an address
        `addr`, frequency `freq`, bits per second `bps`, and length of the zeros
        between repetititions `zero_gap`. These should be specified in an object
        `properties` in the POST body.

        Maximum number of addresses which can be learned by this device.
        Typical values are 1 (for devices whose corresponding transmitters
        ship with DIP switches, allowing the user to manually put all
        transmitters on the same address) and 5 (for devices where each
        transmitter is shipped with a random address).

        Number of times a new address has been learned on this boot.
        Useful in UI design to know that the learn process completed,
        even if the learned address is the same.
