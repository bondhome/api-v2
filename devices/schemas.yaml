    template:
      description: |
        An internal name describing what sort of protocol the remote represented
        by the device implements. Upon a POST with a valid template string, the
        device self-populates its panel with some default controls, initializes
        its state, and finds a script to define its behavior.

        Most templated devices need additional parameters, such as an address
        `addr`, frequency `freq`, bits per second `bps`, and length of the zeros
        between repetititions `zero_gap`. These should be specified in an object
        `properties` in the POST body.

        Whether or not the Bond should trust its toggleable state belief.
        This is the confidence the Bond has that this device's state
        belief is accurate, and is only present if a "Toggle" command is present
        (for `power`, `light`, `direction`, etc.), and is `false` by default.

      type: integer
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        Maximum number of addresses which can be learned by this device.
        Typical values are 1 (for devices whose corresponding transmitters
        ship with DIP switches, allowing the user to manually put all
        transmitters on the same address) and 5 (for devices where each
        transmitter is shipped with a random address).

      description: |
        Milliseconds remaining before learn window closes.
    learn_window_open:

      description: |
        Whether new address can be learned via RF.
        True iff learn_window_remaining_ms is nonzero.

      example: 0
      type: integer
      readOnly: true
      description: |
        Number of times a new address has been learned on this boot.
        Useful in UI design to know that the learn process completed,
        even if the learned address is the same.
    addr0_is_dip:
      example: True
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If present and true, indicates that the receiver has DIP switches
        which may be adjusted to set the zeroth address.
