    A quick description of `trust_state` by example follows:

    The scenario: the Bond has a "ToggleLight" command, and the Bond believes
    the light to be on. The user requests the action "LightOn". If the Bond trusts
    its state, it will *do nothing*, as the light is already on, and sending a
    toggle command would turn it off. If, however, the Bond does not trust its
    state, it will send the toggle, and believe that now it knows the true state
    of the physical device.

    `trust_state` set to `false` is mostly useful if the user intends to use a
    physical remote together with the Bond and is the default, `trust state` set
    to `true` is mostly useful if the user would like to control their device
    remotely with complete confidence that what the Bond reports is the device's
    actual state.

  summary: Read Power Cycle State
  description: |
    This feature is intended to be used with smart Ceiling Fan receivers
    that are connected to "dumb" wall switches. Many users have existing
    non-smart ceiling fans which are connected to non-smart wall switches.
    These non-smart ceiling fans typically have some pull switches where
    the user can set the desired state, and then the wall switch is used
    as the means of operating the device. For example, the ceiling fan may
    be the primary light source in the room, and the user relies on the wall
    switch as a normal light switch. When they then make the fan smart
    by adding a Smart By Bond receiver to the fan, they expect that they
    can continue to use the wall switch. A problem arises when the user
    turns off the fan light using the API (Alexa, app, etc.) and then
    enters the room and attempts to operate using the wall switch. The fan
    will remain in the state with light off. The Power On State feature allows
    users to guarantee a prefered state every time the device powers on,
    making it easier to use in a situation where the wall switch is relied upon.

    This feature is only available on certain SBB products where it makes sense,
    specifically all ceiling fans. We have not enabled it on in-wall switches
    and dimmers and other SBB products where there is only a power supply
    or circuit breaker behind the product, rather than there possibly being
    a user-facing "dumb" wall switch.

  summary: Update state belief
  description: |
    Update the Bond's belief about the state of a device.

    This is useful, for example, for Ceiling Fans that have a command
    for ToggleLight, but no discrete commands TurnLightOn and TurnLightOff.
    In this case, it is possible for the Bond's belief about the device
    state to be incorrect, and so this method allows that belief
    to be corrected.

    This does NOT cause the Bond to transmit any control signal.

    (Bridge-Only)

    The state of the device lock can be patched using the `_lock_priority` and 
    `_lock_expiration` fields. For the case of reseting the lock to the default state,
    respecting the priority of other requests that may had happen, utilize the negative 
    of the setted priority value.
    Example: If one of yours APIs utilizes a `_lock_priority` of 60 when acting into a device,
    remove the lock patching it with a value of -60.

    Provides the current SBB remote address and information about the learn window.
    The SBB unit will only honor commands received with a matching address.

    NOTE: If `addr0_is_dip` is present and true, then the first address (addr0)
    corresponds to physical "DIP" switches on the receiver.
    The client _may_ take this into account by seperately listing this "DIP"
    setting from the rest of the addresses which may be set via the API.
    Note that the special address `0xdead` indicates that the DIP setting
    is being ignored (after it has been explicitely deleted via the API).

  summary: Modify Device Remote Address or Learn Window
  description: |
    [SBB-only]
    Modify either the Device Remote Address or open/close the learn window.
    While the learn window is open, the SBB unit may learn
    a new physical remote when user presses the Learn button
    (or holds down the Power/Stop button for 5 seconds).

    Note that on most SBB receivers, the learn window is automatically opened
    when electrical power is first connected. This is the typical "auto-learning" function.
    However, on recievers with DIP switches
    (`addr0_is_dip`), the learn window must be opened manually. This is because
    those receivers follow the conceptually simpler model of "you gotta set the DIP
    switches on the reciever and transmitter to match" without any "magic learning"
    occuring---at least until you use the Manage Remotes feature of the Bond Home app
    or this endpoint directly.

    Note that to add a new remote address, the `addr` field should be PATCHed
    with a single string, not an array. The provided address will be appended
    to the array of addresses, with the oldest address being overwritten if
    len(`addr[]`) was already equal to `addr_slots`.

    If the same address is learned which was already in the list,
    the duplicate *will indeed* be added.
    This is to allow an installer to use a low-tech way of forgetting
    unwanted remotes---by re-learning the same remote 5 times---which the
    installers are used to doing with similar receivers.

    This endpoint is useful especially where there are multiple SBB devices
    on the same mains circuit.

    If no `addr` is provided, then:
      Restores factory default Device Remote Address and closes learn window.
      If the receiver has DIP switches (`addr0_is_dip`) then the default address
      will be determined by the position of those DIP switches.

    However, if `addr` is provided, then:
      Removes just the specified address from the list.
      If the receiver has DIP switches (`addr0_is_dip`)
      and the address being deleted is the first one (addr0)
      then that address will be changed to `0xdead`.
      This is useful if a receiver is installed with DIP switches
      indicating an address which is being used by a neighbor.
      To avoid interference, the user can delete addr0 via the app.
      NOTE: Any change to the DIP switches on the reciever will
      cause the addr0 to change to reflect that new DIP setting.
