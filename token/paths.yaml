  summary: Get Local API Token
  description: |
    Request token for accessing Bond over local network.

    If `locked` is true, reply will contain neither the token nor account_code.

    Typical use case for this endpoint is:

       - request GET, finding that the endpoint is locked
       - perform PATCH with `"locked": 0`, correct `pin`, and desired `account_code`
       - request GET again to get `token`
       - perform PATCH with `"locked": 1`

    Alternatively, user may perform the proof-of-ownership event
    (such as holding down the Power button on a SBB remote for 5 sec),
    which will unlock the endpoint. In that case, the API client should
    poll GET waiting for unlock.

    Lastly, this endpoint is unlocked for 10 minutes following power cycle.

    Note: The token is not required for /sys/version and /token endpoints.
    However, all other endpoints require token to be provided in a BOND-Token
    HTTP header.

    If locked, then `pin` must be provided.

    If `pin` is required but not provided or incorrect,
    a 401 will be returned.
