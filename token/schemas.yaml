TokenGet:
  properties:
    locked:
      example: 0
      type: integer
      description: |
        If 1, means that client must provide pin to unlock.

        Alternatively, the Bond user may perform an out-of-band proof-of-ownership event
        on the physical Bond unit to cause this field to become 0.
    token:
      example: "8f514567acaf9869"
      type: string
      description: |
        Token for controlling this Bond over local network.

        Required to be provided as an HTTP header for all local communications.

        This is a hex representation of a random uint64,
        which is regenerated on Bond factory reset.

        Only provided if locked is 0.
    account_code:
      example: "1234567890"
      type: string
      description: |
        Account code previously set by PATCH.

        Only provided if locked is 0.
    nonce:
      example: "876a2b14c55b3e5a"
      type: string
      description: |
        Random 64-bit hex string generated whenever client sets account_code,
        even if accound_code is unmodified.
    pin_attempts_left:
      example: 9
      type: integer
      description: |
        Number of times which the PIN may be guessed.

        Once `pin_attempts_left` reaches 0, user must either use an
        out-of-band proof-of-ownership event, or reboot/power-cycle the Bond.
    disable:
      example: false
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If disabled, HTTP and other local APIs will not require token to function.
        Only disable on trusted networks, and only when using fixed IP addresses
        to avoid controlling the wrong Bond. Defaults to false, i.e., token required by default.
        Available as of firmware v2.10.2.
    identify:
      example: 10
      type: integer
      description: |
        [MT-1500 only] [v4.24+]
        Identify duration in seconds (0-30).

        When present, indicates the product supports the identify feature.

        To trigger identify, PATCH this field with a value from 1 to 30,
        specifying how many seconds the identify animation should run.

        To cancel an ongoing identify animation, PATCH with 0.

        The identify feature displays a radar/sonar-style animation (expanding
        concentric circles from center point) on the device's LED matrix to help
        users locate a specific Mate when multiple units are deployed.

        The animation uses the currently configured brightness setting and can
        be dismissed early by pressing any button on the device.

        Authentication: Either the token must be unlocked (locked=0) OR a valid
        token must be provided in the request header. This does not affect the
        locked state or discovery age of the token endpoint.

        Read-only when retrieved via GET. Value indicates remaining seconds of
        current identify animation, or 0 if not currently identifying.
TokenPatch:
  properties:
    locked:
      example: 0
      type: integer
      description: |
        If 1, means that the client wants to immediately re-lock this endpoint.

        If 0,Â means that the client wants to unlock the endpoint.
    account_code:
      example: "1234567890"
      type: string
      description: |
        10-digit account code, used to specify which account to associate the Bond with.

        (Absolute maximum for this field is 16 alpha-numeric characters)

        This does NOT include any checksum digits which may be added when displayed
        for the customer in the app, and required by the Bond WebGUI to eliminate typo issues.
    pin:
      example: "1234"
      type: string
      description: |
        Pin number, if required, as part of unlocking procedure.

        If disabled, HTTP and other local APIs will not require token to function.
        Only disable on trusted networks, and only when using fixed IP addresses
        to avoid controlling the wrong Bond. Defaults to false, i.e., token required by default.
    identify:
      example: 10
      type: integer
      description: |
        [MT-1500 only] [v4.24+]
        Identify duration in seconds (0-30).

        Set to 1-30 to trigger identify animation for that many seconds.
        Set to 0 to cancel an ongoing identify animation.

        Requires either unlocked token (locked=0) OR valid token in request header.
        Does not affect token locked state or discovery age.
