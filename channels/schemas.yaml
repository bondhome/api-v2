Channel:
  type: object
  properties:
    name:
      example: "North Screen"
      type: string
      description: |
        User-facing name of the channel, displayed in the app.
        Maximum length: 64 bytes of UTF-8.
    label:
      example: "N Screen"
      type: string
      description: |
        [MT-1500 only]
        Optional display label shown on the device's LED matrix.
        Limited to A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, and "-" characters.
        Maximum length: 20 characters.
        When not set, the device may display an abbreviated version of the name.
        Allows separating the full name (for app display) from a shorter label
        (for the more limited matrix display).
    template:
      example: "RMS12"
      type: string
      description: |
        Technology template assigned to this channel (R-number identifier).
        Determines the RF protocol used for motor control.
        Uses the same R-number format as the devices API.

        To configure a channel for Relay mode (BondSync-only communication
        relayed via Bridge), set template to "(relay)". [since v4.24.2]
        Relay channels have type "MS" but expose no actions since control
        is handled by the paired Bridge device.

        Not present for channel 0 (All channel).
    properties:
      type: object
      description: |
        Technology-specific properties for this channel.
        Contents vary based on the assigned `template`.

        Not present for channel 0 (All channel).
      properties:
        mfg:
          example: 0
          type: integer
          description: |
            Manufacturer code or technology identifier.
        pairing_assets_key:
          example: ""
          type: string
          description: |
            Reference to pairing assets or instructions.
      example:
        mfg: 0
        pairing_assets_key: ""
    type:
      readOnly: true
      example: "MS"
      type: string
      description: |
        [v4.24+] [MT-1500 only]
        Channel type, automatically inferred from the configured technology template.
        Uses the same enumeration as devices:
        - `MS`: Motorized Window Coverings (Shades, Screens, Drapes, Awnings)
        - `LT`: Light
        - `CF`: Ceiling Fan
        - `GX`: Generic device
        - `FP`: Fireplace
        - `BD`: Bidet

        Channels configured for Relay mode have type `MS`.

        Not present for channel 0.
    enabled:
      example: true
      type: boolean
      description: |
        [v4.24+] [MT-1500 only]
        Channel visibility toggle. When false, the channel is hidden from the
        physical cycling interface (skipped when pressing Channel +/- buttons)
        and appears grayed out in the app.

        All channel configuration (name, technology, schedules, etc.) is preserved
        when a channel is disabled.

        When channel 0 (All) is disabled, it is skipped during physical cycling.
        For bitmap-based protocols (ARC, Gaposa, etc.), disabled individual channels
        are masked from the channel 0 bitmap. For RTS and other protocols where
        channel 0 has its own address, the signal transmits normally.

        Schedules configured for disabled channels will not execute.

        Defaults to true.
    actions:
      readOnly: true
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      example:
        - "Raise"
        - "Lower"
        - "Stop"
        - "SetPosition"
      description: |
        [v4.24+] [MT-1500 only]
        List of actions available on this channel, determined by the channel's
        technology and type. Used for configuring schedules and built-in scenes.

        Common actions by type:
        - Motorized Shades (MS): Raise, Lower, Stop, SetPosition, Preset
        - Lights (LT): TurnLightOn, TurnLightOff, SetBrightness

        Note: Unlike devices, channels do not expose a Features field or maintain state.
        The actions list may include any action supported by the technology without
        strict atomicity requirements.

        Relay channels (template: "(relay)") will return an empty actions array since
        control is handled by the paired Bridge device. [since v4.24.2]

        Not present for channel 0.
