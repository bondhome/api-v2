GetList:
  description: |
    Returns a list of all channels.

    Applies to Mate Pro (MT-1500) and Sidekick Blue (SKS-500-B).

    Mate Pro supports 16 channels: channel 0 (All) and 15 individual channels (1-15).

    Each channel can be configured with a different technology (RF protocol).
    Channel 0 (All) is a special channel that broadcasts to all paired motors.
    The hash tree structure indicates when channel metadata has changed.

  summary: Get specific channel
  description: |
    Get information about a specific channel.

    Applies to Mate Pro (MT-1500) and Sidekick Blue (SKS-500-B).

    Channel 0 is the "All" channel that broadcasts to all paired motors.
    Channel 0 only supports name, label, and enabled fields.

    Channels 1-15 are for controlling specific motors or groups of motors.
    Each channel can be independently configured with:
    - A custom name and label (displayed on device's LED matrix)
    - A technology/protocol (R-number identifier)
    - Technology-specific parameters (addresses, frequencies, etc.)
    - Channel type (auto-inferred from technology)
    - Available actions (for schedules and built-in scenes)
    - Visibility state (enabled/disabled)

    For channel 0 (All), only name, label, and enabled fields can be modified.

    For channels 1-15, changing the technology template may affect available
    pairing procedures, required properties, compatible motors and devices,
    channel type, and available actions.
