GetList:
  description: |
    Returns a list of all channels.

    Applies to Mate Pro (MT-1500) and Sidekick Blue (SKS-500-B).

    Mate Pro supports 15 individual channels (1-15).

    Each channel can be configured with a different technology (RF protocol).
    The hash tree structure indicates when channel metadata has changed.

  summary: Get specific channel
  description: |
    Get information about a specific channel.

    Applies to Mate Pro (MT-1500) and Sidekick Blue (SKS-500-B).

    Channels 1-15 are for controlling specific motors or groups of motors.
    Each channel can be independently configured with:
    - A custom name (displayed on device's LED matrix)
    - A technology/protocol (R-number identifier)
    - Technology-specific parameters (addresses, frequencies, etc.)

  summary: Modify channel metadata
  description: |
    Modifies metadata of a channel, such as name, label, and technology assignment.

    Applies to Mate Pro (MT-1500) and Sidekick Blue (SKS-500-B).

    ### Channel Names and Labels
    - `name`: User-facing name displayed in the app (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, "-", max 20 chars)
    - `label`: [MT-1500 only] Optional display label for the device's LED matrix

    The label allows for a shorter display name on the matrix while preserving
    the full name for app display.

    ### Technology Assignment
    The `template` field specifies the RF protocol used by this channel (R-number identifier).
    Changing the technology may affect:
    - Available pairing procedures
    - Required properties (addr, freq, bps, etc.)
    - Compatible motors and devices
