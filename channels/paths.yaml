GetList:
  description: |
    Returns a list of all channels on this Mate Pro remote.

    Mate Pro supports 15 individual channels (1-15).

    Each channel can be configured with a different technology (RF protocol).
    The hash tree structure indicates when channel metadata has changed.

  summary: Get specific channel
  description: |
    Get information about a specific channel on this Mate Pro remote.

    Channels 1-15 are for controlling specific motors or groups of motors.
    Each channel can be independently configured with:
    - A custom name (displayed on Mate's LED matrix)
    - A technology/protocol (e.g., RTS, ARC, etc.)
    - Technology-specific parameters (addresses, frequencies, etc.)

  summary: Modify channel metadata
  description: |
    Modifies metadata of a channel, such as name and label.

    ### Channel Names
    Channel names are limited to:
    - Characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, and "-"
    - Maximum length: 20 characters
    - Names are displayed on Mate Pro's 13Ã—13 LED matrix using marquee scrolling when needed

    ### Technology Assignment
    The `template` field specifies the RF protocol used by this channel.
    Changing the technology may affect:
    - Available pairing procedures
    - Required properties (addr, freq, bps, etc.)
    - Compatible motors and devices

    Note: For Day 1, technology assignment can also be done directly on the Mate Pro
    via its physical interface. The app must support reading and writing the technology
    via this API.
