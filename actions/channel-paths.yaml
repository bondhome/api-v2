  summary: Execute a Channel Action
  description: |
    **[v4.24+] [MT-1500 only] Development and testing endpoint**

    `action_name` is the name of the action from the `actions` list in
    the response to GET `/channels/{channel_id}`.

    This endpoint executes an action directly on a channel by transmitting
    via the configured RF technology/protocol for that channel.

    **Note:** Mate is not intended to act as a bridge. This endpoint is
    provided for development and testing purposes only, allowing
    verification that channels are properly configured and actions
    execute correctly. It is directly analogous to the device and group
    action endpoints.

    This endpoint blocks until confirmation that Mate has transmitted
    the action. Timeout shall be no more than 7 seconds.

    Available actions depend on the channel's configured technology and
    channel type. Common actions include:
    - Shade channels: Raise, Lower, Hold, SetPosition, Preset
    - Light channels: TurnLightOn, TurnLightOff, SetBrightness

    See the channels endpoint documentation for the full list of available
    actions per channel.
