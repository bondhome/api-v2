  summary: Execute a device action
  description: |
    `action_name` is the name of the action from the `actions` list in
    the response to GET `/devices/{device_id}`.

    This endpoint blocks until confirmation that the Bond has executed
    the action. Timeout shall be no more than 7 seconds.

    To check the resulting state, the client may query
    `/devices/{device_id}/state`.

    See the Features section to learn what the various actions mean,
    and what argument is expected, if any.
    For example, the action `SetSpeed` takes an integer parameter
    which is the desired speed number.

    When performing an action, the device can be locked with a priority and 
    expiration time, using the optional fields `_lock_priority` and `_lock_expiration`. 

    Any other action that has a lower priority (higher priority number) will not
    be executed if the `_lock_expiration` is not expired. Actions with higher
    priority (lower priority number) will be executed and will acquire the lock.

    If `_lock_priority` is not specified, the default value `100` is assumed.
