  summary: Execute a device action
  description: |
    `action_name` is the name of the action from the `actions` list in
    the response to GET `/devices/{device_id}`.

    This endpoint blocks until confirmation that the Bond has executed
    the action. Timeout shall be no more than 7 seconds.

    To check the resulting state, the client may query
    `/devices/{device_id}/state`.

    See the Features section to learn what the various actions mean,
    and what argument is expected, if any.
    For example, the action `SetSpeed` takes an integer parameter
    which is the desired speed number.
