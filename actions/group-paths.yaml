  summary: Execute a Group Action
  description: |
    `action_name` is the name of the action from the `actions` list in
    the response to GET `/groups/{group_id}`.

    This endpoint blocks until confirmation that the Bond has executed
    the Action on all member Devices. Timeout shall be no more than 7 seconds.

    To check the resulting state, the client may query
    `/groups/{group_id}/state`, but the member Device States are also updated.
