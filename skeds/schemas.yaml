        If false, schedule will never execute, but will remain in device database.

        Oneshot schedules (with `days_of_week` all False) automatically
        disable after executing once.

        Defaults to true on PUT and POST.
    action:
      example: SetBrightness
      required: true
      type: string

        Action which will be run on device when schedule executes.
        If action requires an argument, `argument` field is required.
    argument:
      example: 80
      type: any

        Argument to action, if needed.
    seconds:
      example: -3600
      required: true
      type: integer
      description: |
        Time at which schedule should execute, relative to `mark`,
        in seconds. Negative numbers indicate "before" the mark,
        positive numbers indicate "after" the mark.
    mark:
      example: sunset
      required: true

        Event which serves as the benchmark for the daily relative time.
        Options are:
           - "midnight": `seconds` is the time in seconds
             since midnight in the timezone specified by the sys/time endpoint.

           - "sunrise": `seconds` is seconds before or after local sunrise,
             as calculated using the Grid Locator (see sys/time endpoint).

           - "sunset": like sunrise but when the sun goes down!

        For our beloved customers in the Arctic Circle: please note that
         there will be periods of days around the solstices that
         schedules based on sunrise/sunset marks will not execute.
