        If false, schedule will never execute, but will remain in device database.

        Oneshot schedules (with `days_of_week` all False) automatically
        disable after executing once.

        Defaults to true on PUT and POST.
    action:
      example: SetBrightness
      type: string
      description: |
        Action which will be run on device when schedule executes.
        If action requires an argument, `argument` field is required.
    argument:
      example: 80
      type: any

        Argument to action, if needed.
    seconds:
      example: -3600
      type: integer
      description: |
        Time at which schedule should execute, relative to `mark`,
        in seconds. Negative numbers indicate "before" the mark,
        positive numbers indicate "after" the mark.
    days_of_week:
      example: [false, true, true, true, true, true, false]
      type: array
      description: |
        Days of week on which the schedule should execute.

        First element is for Sunday, last element is for Saturday.

        The example value is for a schedules that executes only on weekdays.

        Special case: if array is all `false`, the sked will run exactly once
        and will then disable itself (enabled=false). This is rendered on UIs as
        a "Run Once" option.

        Default: run every day, that is, array of 7 trues
    mark:
      example: sunset
      type: string
      description: |
        Event which serves as the benchmark for the daily relative time.
        Options are:
           - `midnight`: `seconds` is the time in seconds
             since midnight in the timezone specified by the sys/time endpoint.

           - `sunrise`: `seconds` is seconds before or after local sunrise,
             as calculated using the Grid Locator (see sys/time endpoint).

           - `sunset`: like sunrise but when the sun goes down!

           - `dawn`: `seconds` is seconds before or after local civil dawn:
             that is, when it gets light outside before sunrise.
             This is when sun is 6 degrees below the horizon.

           - `dusk`: like dawn, but for civil dusk: when it actually gets dark
             some time after sunset, when the sun has descending 6 degrees below the horizon.

        **For our beloved customers near or within the Arctic Circle:** please note that
         there will be periods of days around the solstices that
         schedules based on the solar marks will not execute.
