  summary: Create new Scene Schedule
  description: |
    Creates a Scene Schedule under a specific Scene.

    Note that `action` must not be set for Scene Schedules.

    If the timezone or location settings in `sys/time` are not set,
    a 400 error may result depending on what `mark` is requested.
    Specifically, the following requests will result in an 400 error:

       - POSTed `mark` is `midnight` but `sys/time.tz` is `null`
       - POSTed `mark` is `dawn`, `dusk`, `sunrise`, or `sunset`, but `sys/time.grid` or `sys/time.tz` is `null`
