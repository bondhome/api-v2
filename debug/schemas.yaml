          - `2`: RX continuous scan
          - `3`: TX simulated packet continuously
          - `4`: TX brief burst

        "TX simulated packet" and "TX brief burst" modes.
    power:
      example: 127
      type: number
      description: |
        Power level, from 0-127.

        Note: In production-firmware, power-level is restricted per frequency
        and duty-cycle for compliance.
    freq:
      example: 434000
      type: number
      description: |
        Frequency in integer kHz.

        Note: In production-firmware, frequency is restricted to authorized
        ranges.

      type: number
      description: |
        Select antenna number (valid values: 1, 5, 2, 3).

        Antenna selection is ephemeral and will be overridden by other settings.

        Note: In production-firmware, this field is read-only.

BeauDb:
  properties:
    live_records:
      example: 20
      type: string
      description: |
        Number of "live" records in the database.
    dead_records:
      example: 33
      type: string
      description: |
        Number of "dead" records in the database.
        These are records marked for deletion but which have not yet been
        erased through compaction.
    empty_pages:
      example: 0
      type: string
      description: |
        Number of pages which are entirely empty.
        This will be large initially, then reduce to 1 (the swap page).
        This may be 0 for older databases and in case of power loss
        during compaction, however it should go back to 1 after the next
        compaction as a new swap page results.
    total_dead:
      example: 110824
      type: string
      description: |
        Total amount of memory used by dead records.
        Dead records are counted as free space.
    total_free:
      example: 900421
      type: string
      description: |
        Total free space in database (including dead space), in bytes.
    max_free:
      example: 4002
      type: string
      description: |
        Maximum freespace of any page, in bytes,
        excepting the swap page (a single empty page kept to permit
        compaction).
        In current (v2.6) implementation, this is the typical limit on
        the largest record which can be written to the database.
    total_head:
      example: 900421
      type: string
      description: |
        Total free space in database (including dead space), in bytes.
    min_head:
      example: 15
      type: string
      description: |
        Minimum amount of headroom of any page, in bytes.
        This dictates the smallest record which could result in a compaction.
    compactions:
      example: 1
      type: string
      description: |
        Number of compactions performed since boot.
    size:
      example: 1048576
      type: string
      description: |
        Total size of database, in bytes.
    page_size:
      example: 4096
      type: string
      description: |
        Size of each page, in bytes.
    dirty:
      example: false
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates that a write failed and database is in an inconsistant state.
