    Get status from the LED driver.

    If `manual` is `0`, `value` reflects the instantaneous value of the LEDs,
    and may change rapidly and automatically.

  summary: Manually control LEDs
  description: |
    Use this endpoint to manually control LEDs, such as during factory test.
    Be sure to use the `manual` field to prevent `value` from being overridden
    from automatic LED control.

    If `manual` is `0` or absent, `value` may still be set, but may be overridden
    at any time.
