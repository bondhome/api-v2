    The `shutdown` field indicates the power state of the Wi-Fi (+BLE) radio:
       - `0`: normal operation
       - `1`: low-power shutdown mode

    If the `shutdown` field is not present, assume normal operation.

    Set `shutdown` to `1` or `0` to control the Wi-Fi (+BLE) radio power level. A value
    of `1` turns this radio off.

    These settings do not persist past reboot.
