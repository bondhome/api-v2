      (Bond Bridge only)
      Intended for use in debugging signal generation. All values false by default.
      
      `silence_tx` stops the Bond Bridge
      from transmitting anything. It should otherwise behave normally: the LEDs flash,
      device state should change, etc.

      `log_signals` causes all signals to be sent to sent to any listeners as they
      are generated. They are sent on the topic `debug/rfman/signal`, and could be
      monitored by a BPUP client listening on this topic. This is intended as a testing
      tool for remote building, to verify whether signals are generated as expected.
