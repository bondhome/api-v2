    All these settings require `manual` to be set before they take effect.

    Use this endpoint only as part of an FCC or factory test program.

    NOTE: In production firmware, FCC compliance is ensured via power,
    frequency, and antenna restrictions on this endpoint.
    If a setting beyond FCC limits is requested, a `200` will be returned,
    but upon subsequent GET, the values may either be unchanged or truncated.
