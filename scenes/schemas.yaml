        Array of actions to be executed when the Scene is run.

        This field must contain at least one action during Scene creation.
        It may be updated using PATCH.

        This field may be missing for imorted Scenes,
        which means that the Scene is opaque (i.e. the Bond Bridge does not know
        what the Scene does) and may only be edited on the partner system it was
        imported from. See `imported_from` field.
      type: array
      example:
        - {"device": "aabbccdd", "action": "TurnOn"}
        - {"group": "11223344", "action": "SetBrightness", "argument": 50}
    types:
      readOnly: true

        For values, see `type` field of Device schema.

        Automatically set by the Bond Bridge to be the set of types of the
        underlying devices. Note that Scene types is always an array, even if it has zero or one element.
        In the event that a Scene contains Groups, the types of the underlying devices
        are used to determine the Scene types array.

        When devies of multiple types are mixed in a single Scene,
        this `types` lists each type.
        For example, a Ceiling Fan (CF) and a Light (LT) combined would be
        ["CF", "LT"] (with the order being aribitrary).
      example:
        - "MS"
      type: array
    locations:
      readOnly: true
      example:
         - Kitchen
      type: array

        Similar to `types`, if all Devices in the Scene are in the same Location,
        this field will be an array with a single string. However, when Devices
        from multiple Locations are combined in one Scene, this field lists
        each unique Location in arbitrary order.
      imported_from:
        description: |
          If the Scene was imported from a Managed Technology (that is, a parter control system),
          this field contains the ID of the partner system. The corresponding endpoint on the 
          Bridge for managing this technology is `api/{imported_from}` and the WebGUI is
          at `http://{bridge_ip_address}/{imported_from}`.
