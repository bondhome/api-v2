      Returns a list of Group IDs and the corresponding Group hashes.
      The hashes change if any part of the Group (its name, state, type, etc.)
      has changed. The hash is not updated if underlying Devices are updated
      in a way which does not effect the Group state or type.

      Groups are only supported on Bond Bridges, not on Smart by Bond.
      Furthermore, Groups may only include Devices on the same Bridge.

    summary: Create new Group
    description: |
      For the creation of a Group distributed across multiple Bonds,
      clients should provide a 64-bit ID for the Group and provide that
      same ID in each Group POST request in the `_id` field. See
      introductory section "Groups and Scenes" for detail. If the `_id`
      field is not provided, a random ID will be assigned as with
      POST requests to other enumerations.

      A Group is created containing the device IDs in the `devices` array.
      Using the `devices` field requires
      the client to predetermine what devices are compatible in the sense
      of having a non-empty Actions intersection. If even a single device is
      incompatible, then the entire POST will fail with a 400 error.
      For this reason, it is
      simpler for the client to make individual Groups Devices POSTs for each
      device to be added to the Group, so that the Bond firmware may provide
      a 400 error in case a device cannot be added due to incompatability.

      Note that `types` and `locations` fields cannot be specified when
      creating a Group: these fields are calculated based on the member Devices.

    See the Features section above for other properties which may be available

    Similar to the Group State object, the Properties available for a Group
    are those Properties which exist on every Device in the Group.
    If all Devices have the same value for a Property, then that value will
    be provided here. If Devices do not agree on a value, then that Property
    will be listed but with a `null` value.

  description: |
    PATCHing one or more Group Properties implicitely PATCHes those Properties
    on all Devices in the Group. Gratuitous PATCH replies are sent for each
    Device before this PATCH reply returns. If any errors occur in any of the
    underlying Device PATCH requests, this request will return a 500 error
    and the Devices' Properties will be left in undefined condition.

    Example: If you set up 8 individual shades in your kitchen and then add
    them all to a Group, you can then, with a single request, enable or disable
    the `feature_position` Property to enable/disable the "slider" feature.
    [This "slider" feature is avaiable only on the Bond Bridge Pro.]
