        List of member Device IDs.

        This field may be set during Group creation,
        or may be updated using PATCH.

        Alternatively, use the Group Devices endpoint's POST/DELETE
        methods to add/remove Devides from the Group.
      type: array
      example:
        - "aabbccdd"
        - "11223344"
        - "deadbeef"
    types:
      readOnly: true

        For values, see `type` field of Device schema.

        Type is automatically set by the Bond Bridge to be the type of the
        underlying devices when all devices are of the same type. Note that
        Group types is always an array, even if it has zero or one element.

        When devies of multiple types are mixed in a single Group,
        this `types` lists each type.
        For example, a Ceiling Fan (CF) and a Light (LT) combined would be
        ["CF", "LT"] (with the order being aribitrary).
      example:
        - "MS"
      type: array
    locations:
      readOnly: true
      example:
         - Kitchen
      type: array

        Similar to `types`, if all Devices in the Group are in the same Location,
        this field will be an array with a single string. However, when Devices
        from multiple Locations are combined in one Group, this field lists
        each unique Location in arbitrary order.
    actions:
      readOnly: true
      type: array
      example:
        - "Open"
        - "Close"
        - "Preset"

        The list of available Actions on the Group.
        This is the intersection of Actions for the Devices in the Group.
        In other words, the Group Actions are those Actions which are common
        to all Devices in the Group.
