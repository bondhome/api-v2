  description: |
    Get the current configuration for all three Quick Action Buttons (K1, K2, K3)

    execute programmable actions via key_links (keystream mode).

    Default configuration:
    - K1: goto channel 0 (All)
    - K2: goto channel 5
    - K3: goto channel 10

  summary: Modify Quick Action Button configuration
  description: |
    Modify the configuration for Quick Action Buttons on Mate Pro (MT-1500).

    You can update one or more buttons in a single request. Only include the
    buttons you want to modify.

    Mode switching behavior:
    - Switching from keystream to goto mode: Previously configured key_links
      are hidden in the app but preserved. They can be viewed again by switching
      back to keystream mode.

    - Switching from goto to keystream mode: The button will resume transmitting
      BondSync signals and executing any previously configured key_links.

    Physical programming:
    When a button is in goto mode, users can set the target channel by holding
    the button for 2 seconds while on the desired channel. This updates the
    `channel` field in the configuration.

    Note: When mode=goto, the `channel` field is required. When mode=keystream,
    the `channel` field is ignored.
